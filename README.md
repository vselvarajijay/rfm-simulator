Simulating customer likeliness to purchase through RFM

RFM is a strategy for analyzing and estimating the value of a customer, based on three data points: Recency (How recently did the customer make a purchase?), Frequency (How often do they purchase), and Monetary Value (How much do they spend?).

These three factors can be used to reasonably predict how likely (or unlikely) it is that a customer will re-purchase from a company. 

RFM analysis classifies customers with a numerical ranking for each of the three categories, with the ideal customer earning the highest score in each of the three categories. So, for example, depending on the purchase cycle of your company's product or service you might evaluate customers for recency on a scale of 1-10, with a score of 10 indicating the customer had made a purchase from your company within the last month, and a score of 1 indicating that their last purchase was 10-12 months prior.

Once a company has decided on its 1-10 scale for each of the three categories, it can review its CRM and give each customer a score for each category. Then, by adding up the three combined scores, companies can run an RFM analysis to determine which companies are most likely to buy again soon, and use that information to prioritize how they're reaching out to and creating value for those high-value customers.

It's important to note that, while an RFM analysis can provide a quick snapshot of which customers have purchased most recently to prioritize nurturing and loyalty efforts, it doesn't necessarily mean they want to hear all of your offers, all the time. Make sure you still have a clear system in place for customer communication so they aren't constantly getting bombarded with emails and calls from your colleagues. That could alienate them, and eventually make them switch to a competitor. High RFM analysis scores should be a signal to learn from a customer, rather than to try to sell more to them right off the bat.

An RFM analysis is simply a tool to give you an idea of how much of your revenue comes from repeat customers vs. new customers, and which levers you can pull to try to make customers happier so they become repeat purchasers. Your company's RFM analysis might indicate that customers aren't satisfied with your product or service after their initial purchase, or that customers who are upsold or cross-sold are more likely to purchase again than other customers.

An RFM analysis helps you find commonalities and differences between customers who repeat purchase and customers who don't to help you learn where there are gaps in your customer experience.
